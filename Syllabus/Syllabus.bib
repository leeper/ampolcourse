  title = {Don't Blame Primary Voters for Polarization},
  journal = {The Forum},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {Article 4},
  number = {4},
  abstract = {In recent years, a number of media commentators and scholars have
	blamed primary voters
	
	for the rise of polarization in American politics. According to this
	argument, primary electorates are dominated by strong partisans whose
	views are more extreme than those of rank-and-file party supporters.
	This article uses data from recent exit polls of primary and general
	election voters as well as the 2006 Cooperative Congressional Election
	Study to test the primary election polarization theory. The evidence
	does not support the theory. In fact there appears to be very little
	difference between the ideologies of each party's primary voters
	and the ideologies of its general election voters. These findings
	suggest that the polarized state of American politics today reflects
	the polarized state of the overall American electorate rather than
	any peculiar characteristics of primary voters. The findings also
	suggest that even after they secure their party's nomination, it
	may be risky for candidates to adopt more moderate policy positions
	in order to appeal to swing voters, because any such move toward
	the center would risk alienating a large proportion of their party's
	electoral base.},

  abstract = {Theory: Using Carmines and Stimson's issue evolution model of partisan
	change, I argue that the abortion issue has transformed the two major
	United States political parties and that this process follows a predictable
	pattern, as outlined by Carmines and Stimson. Hypotheses: By applying
	the theory of issue evolution to abortion, I develop three hypotheses:
	1) The reputation for each party's stance on abortion among party
	elites has grown clearer and more distinct over the last 20 years;
	2) At the mass level, people have changed their party identification
	in a manner consistent with their attitudes on abortion; 3) The changes
	among party elites and masses are caus- ally connected, with elite-level
	changes producing mass-level responses. Methods: Simple time series
	analyses are used on two datasets, roll call votes on abortion in
	the United States Congress and public opinion polls from General
	Social Surveys, 1972-94. Results: Democrats and Republicans shift
	dramatically on the abortion issue at both the elite and mass levels.
	Moreover, this change closely follows with the issue evolution model.
	The process unfolds gradually, and causality appears to run from
	elites to masses, rather than from masses to elites.},

  author = {Bartels, Larry M.},
  number = {0},
  address = {Princeton, NJ},
  abstract = {Unequal Democracy debunks many myths about politics in contemporary
	America, using the widening gap between the rich and the poor to
	shed disturbing light on the workings of American democracy. Larry
	Bartels shows that increasing inequality is not simply the result
	of economic forces, but the product of broad-reaching policy choices
	in a political system dominated by partisan ideologies and the interests
	of the wealthy. Bartels demonstrates that elected officials respond
	to the views of affluent constituents but ignore the views of poor
	people. He shows that Republican presidents in particular have consistently
	produced much less income growth for middle-class and working-poor
	families than for affluent families, greatly increasing inequality.
	He provides revealing case studies of key policy shifts contributing
	to inequality, including the massive Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003
	and the erosion of the minimum wage. Finally, he challenges conventional
	explanations for why many voters seem to vote against their own economic
	interests, contending that working-class voters have not been lured
	into the Republican camp by "values issues" like abortion and gay
	marriage, as commonly believed, but that Republican presidents have
	been remarkably successful in timing income growth to cater to short-sighted
	voters. Unequal Democracy is social science at its very best. It
	provides a deep and searching analysis of the political causes and
	consequences of America's growing income gap, and a sobering assessment
	of the capacity of the American political system to live up to its
	democratic ideals.},

  abstract = {A near-universal consensus exists that the nomination of Robert Bork
	in 1987 triggered a new regime in the Senate's voting over presidential
	nominees—a regime that deemphasizes ethics, competence, and integrity
	and stresses instead politics, philosophy, and ideology. Nonetheless,
	this conventional wisdom remains largely untested. In this paper
	we explore the extent to which the Bork nomination has affected the
	decisions of U.S. senators. To do so, we modernize, update, and backdate
	the standard account of confirmation politics offered by Cameron,
	Cover, and Segal (1990) to cover all candidates for the Supreme Court
	from Hugo L. Black in 1937 through John G. Roberts, Jr. in 2005.
	Our results confirm conventional wisdom about the Bork nomination
	but with two notable caveats. First, while the importance of ideology
	has reached new heights, the Senate's emphasis on this factor had
	its genesis some three decades earlier, in the 1950s. Second, while
	ideology is of paramount concern to senators, a candidate's professional
	merit also remains a significant determinant of success in the Senate.},

	constraints mute the impact of mayors’ partisanship on policy outcomes?
	We hypothesize that mayoral partisanship will more strongly affect
	outcomes in policy areas where there is less shared authority between
	local, state, and federal governments. To test this hypothesis, we
	create a novel dataset combining U.S. mayoral election returns from
	1990 to 2006 with city fiscal data. Using regression discontinuity
	design, we find that cities that elect a Democratic mayor spend a
	smaller share of their budget on public safety, a policy area where
	local discretion is high, than otherwise similar cities that elect
	a Republican or an Independent. We find no differences on tax policy,
	social policy, and other areas that are characterized by significant
	overlapping authority. These results suggest that models ofnational
	policymaking are only partially applicable to U.S. cities. They also
	have implications for political accountability mayors may not be
	able to influence the full range of policies that are nominally local
	responsibilities.},

	frames perceptions of the Court opinion. Furthermore, increased awareness
	of the activities of the Court tends to reinforce legitimacy by exposing
	people to the powerful symbols of law. In 2000, legitimacy did indeed
	seem to provide a reservoir of good will that allowed the Court to

	redistricting institutions, and the political actors who operate
	within them, determined the outcomes of the 2001–02 redistricting
	cycle. I categorize these institutions into two types: redistricting
	that follows the normal legislative process and that which takes
	place through a commission. For those states that use the legislative
	process, when one party controls state government, redistricting
	results in a partisan gerrymander. When there is divided state government,
	a bipartisan compromise results from the legislative process. Commission
	systems differ on membership and voting rules, suggesting two types
	of commissions: partisan and bipartisan. A partisan commission reliably
	produces a partisan map, while a bipartisan commission results in
	a bipartisan compromise.},

	changing the incentives to prospective candidates. Following hypotheses
	suggested by Fiorina (1994, 1996), we argue that term limits have
	changed the incentive structure for typical Democratic candidates
	in some legislatures. This change in incentives has, in turn, affected
	the partisan composition of statehouses just as the professionalization
	movement affected incentives and partisan composition a generation
	ago. We provide quantitative evidence that supports Fiorina's conjectures
	about term limits, suggesting that the presence of term limits provisions
	even before they take effect creates an environment that is less
	attractive to Democratic candidates.},

	early thirties. The risks of incarceration are highly stratified

	in March of 2010 represented only one step forward in a multistep
	policy-making process. The locus of policy-making has now shifted
	to the states, a key venue for implementing health care exchanges
	and other central provisions of the law. Yet, rather than moving
	forward on implementation of the law, the majority of states have
	resisted federal reform in one form or another. This paper examines
	this state-level resistance to “ObamaCare” during its first two years
	and considers potential explanations, identifying a much larger role
	for political factors than for economic considerations.},

	a large degree with the question of the effects of political parties
	on the policy behavior of elected legislators, with most of the research

	the partisan polarization and dimensionality of campaign issue stances
	and roll call voting in the Kansas Senate and the largely comparable,
	though nonpartisan, Nebraska Unicameral. This comparison offers us
	a nice quasi-experiment to assess the impact ofparty by establishing
	a baseline condition in Nebraska for what happens when party is absent.
	We argue that party lends order to conflict, producing the ideological
	low-dimensional space that is a trademark of American politics. Where
	parties are not active in the legislature-Nebraska is our test case-the
	clear structure found in partisan politics disappears. This works
	to sever the connection between voters and their elected representatives
