     - Is polarization good or bad? (in terms of deciding how to vote, being politically engaged, hope for deliberative democracy, etc.)
     - Residential sorting?

   - Is it constitutional? What's the controversy?
     - OLC memo
       - Within the authority of the executive branch to grant deferred action to individuals facing deportation
       - Granting deferred action to parents of U.S. citizens would therefore be consistent with prior deferred actions
       - Granting deferred action to parents of DACA recipients would not be consistent (as it would go against Congressional intent)
       - Executive branch only has the authority to make rules consistent with Congressional intent
   - What's the political response?
