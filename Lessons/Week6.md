 - State and Local Politics
   - Federalism
     - The United States has a complex system of federalism
     - States
     - Counties
     - Cities
     - Regional/district governments w/in states
       - Transportation authorities
       - Port authorities
       - School boards
       - Water and Conservation Districts
     - Direct democratic authority
   
   - Federalism creates between-state diversity
     - Institutions differ
       - Different levels of federalism differ
         - State institutions relatively similar
           - All states have a governor
           - All states have a bicameral legislature except Nebraska
           - All states have a judiciary (but form varies, per last week's discussion)
         - Some states have State-County-City
         - Some states do not have functional counties
         - Some states have regional (cross-county) governments
         - Most states have schools run by independent (non-city or non-county) local governments
         - Large cities (e.g., New York, Chicago, San Francisco) often have county- and state-like authorities
       - Different direct democratic procedures
         - Talk about this in a minute
       - Different constitutional protections
         - Most states borrow
     - Different laws
       - Federal separation of powers
         - Presentation: Sabrina on ObamaCare
         - Congress sets laws that apply universally
         - States have jurisdiction in all other matters
         - Congress can pass laws outside its enumerated powers, but states are not necessarily obligated to follow them
         - "Block grants": Congress doesn't mandate policy, but  incentivizes states with funding for compliance with state laws
           - Ex.: Federal highways are state-built but federally co-financed
           - Ex.: Social welfare programs are state- or local-administered but federally financed per capita
           - Ex.: Primary and secondary education is mostly locally financed, but federal government provides block grant funding to ensure compliance with federal education policies
         - States seen as "laboratories"
           - ObamaCare/ACA implements policy ideas first tried out in states
           - States adopt policies based on what works in other states
         - Presentation: Rikke on Volden article
       - Variation in taxes
         - Congress can basically only generate revenue via income tax and tariffs
         - States can tax almost anything, except interstate commerce
           - Income
           - Property
           - Sales/VAT
           - "Sin" taxes (alcohol, cigarettes, etc.)
           - Gasoline
           - Road tolls
           - Motor vehicle registrations
           - Professional and recreational licenses
         - Local governments have more limited taxation powers
           - Depends on state law and type of government
           - Sales/VAT
           - Property
           - Income in rare cases (very large cities)
     
     - Federalism creates substantial local level diversity
       - Three broad categories of residential settings
         - Urban
           - Large city centers
           - Racially and ethnically diverse
           - Overwhelmingly (esp. in North and West), vote Democratic
           - Historically run by large, patronage-focused "party machines"
           - Machine politics still dominates some cities (Chicago, Philadelphia, New Orleans, etc.)
         - Suburban
           - Suburban populations exploded since WWII
           - Dynamics of "white flight"
           - Suburbs tend to be more white, older, and more conservative than city centers
         - Rural
           - Politics of rural areas varies
           - Tend to be poorer areas, especially in West and South
       - Local politics is strange
         - Counties (except in New England) manage courts, police, most roads, other infrastructure, etc.
         - Sub-county level governments vary a lot
           - Cities tend to be either "home rule"/"charter" cities with wide authority or limited authority over roads, parks, etc.
           - Large cities (e.g., New York, San Francisco, etc.) have merged city and county authorities including judicial oversight, etc.
             - Very large cities may also have sub-city governments with particular geographical or domain
           - Rural areas often do not have cities and thus no permanent government (direct democracy via "township meeting"; esp. in West and New England)
         - Elections are odd
           - Mix of partisan and non-partisan offices
           - Candidates are often all of the same party
           - Issues can be weird (e.g., trash handling policy, etc.)
           - Elections are typically in "off-years" (not simultaneous with national elections)
           - Extremely low turnout
           - Local candidates and elected officials may not be career politicians
             - State legislatures with "low professionalism" and many local offices are seen as "dead-ends"
           - Presentation: Britta on Oliver and Ha article
         
     - Direct democracy in the states
       - Background
         - There is no direct democracy at the national level (by design)
         - Citizens did not gain direct election of U.S. Senators until "Progressive Era" (17th Amendment, 1913)
         - Direct democratic reforms emerged around the same time
         - Essentially meant to transfer authority from state legislatures directly to the people
         - Most prevalent in western states (esp. CA and AZ, CO, MT, NV, ND, OR)
         - All states (except DE) require referenda on amendments to state constitutions
       - Forms of direct democracy
         - Legislature-initiated amendments (49 states)
         - Legislature-initiated statutes (24)
         - Citizen-initiated constitutional amendments (18)
         - Citizen-initiated statutes (21)
           - Direct (referendum is law-making)
           - Indirect (referendum is referring only)
         - "Veto referendum" (25)
         - Recall of elected officials (18)
       - In practice, direct democratic processes operate much like other electoral processes in the U.S.
         - High partisan
         - Involve large spending by interest groups
         - Have relatively low turnout, even in high profile cases
         
 - Activity
   - Working in pairs, research state-to-state variation in a policy area
   - Think about:
     - What are the alternative policies that are in place
     - Why do states differ in their policies in this area?
     - What implications do these state-to-state variations have?
     - What role, if any, does the federal government play in this policy area?
   - 5-minute presentation in class next week
