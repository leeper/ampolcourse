# Congress #

## Outline ##

 - Finish up from last week
   - Activity I
     - What are the most important amendments?
   - Tensions on individual rights
     - What is about fundamental rights?
     - What is about history/politics of revolutionary period?
     - What changed later?
 - Congress
   - Background lecture
     - Institutions
       - Constitution provides minimal framework
       - Each chamber gets to decide its own rules
       - Result:
         - Increasing institutionalization over-time
         - Institutions are path-dependent
         - Institutions structure strategic interactions between chambers, branches, public, and other actors
     - The legislative process
       - "I'm just a bill": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-eYBZFEzf8
       - Each chamber can initiate legislation
         - Revenue-raising bills have to originate in the House
         - Legislation is initiated by members, not President or bureaucracy
       - Chamber delegates initial jurisdiction to one or more committees
       - Committees process and revise bills and then present them to the floor
       - Each chamber has to adopt identical legislation
         - Disagreements are settled in "conference committee"
       - Bills have to be repassed by each chamber
       - Presidential veto opportunity
     - Spatial models
       - The chamber median is what matters
       - Chambers pass legislation strategically based on beliefs about likelihood of passage by other chamber and the President
       - Big question is whether parties are influential aside from ideology: i.e., to parties bias members to vote different from their ideology
     - Common features of both chambers
       - Both chambers have partisan leadership
         - Speaker (House) and President Pro Tempore (Senate) are from majority party
         - Each party has a caucus, run by elected party leadership (Majority leader, minority leader, deputies, whips)
         - All comittees are dominated by the majority party
       - Seniority rules
         - Committee chairmanships, committeee assignments, offices, etc. all assigned by seniority
       - Majority rule on most issues
       - Both chambers are increasingly polarized
       - Both chambers, all committees, and all members have large staffs
     - House
       - Larger chamber (435 members)
       - Members are less powerful and have fewer opportunities to speak
       - Floor debate is heavily constrained, most members are restricted to five-minute speeches
       - Most bills are debated for a limited period of time with limited amendments
       - All amendments must be germane
       - Power is tightly controlled by Speaker and majority leadership
       - Rules committee controls what actually reaches the floor
         - Positive and negative agenda power
         - Final pre-floor jurisdiction on all bills
         - They determine the agenda rule: open, closed, debate time, number of amendments
         - Out of tradition, debate is divided between parties
       - "Hastert Rule"
         - The only legislation voted on the floor is that which is supported by a majority of the majority party
         - Occasionally violated (this is called a "roll")
       - Discharge petition process
     - Senate
       - Small chamber (100 members)
       - Power is more diffuse and access to the floor is unrestricted
       - Floor debate is unstructured and members are not limited by time or germaneness
       - Amendments are unlimited and need not be germane
       - Filibuster
         - Did not always exist
         - Need not actually speak; threat of filibuster is sufficient to prevent a vote
         - 60 vote cloture rule
       - "Holds"

   - Discussion
     - How does Congress compare to other legislative systems?

     - How important are parties for the agenda control and individual members votes?
     - How do we measure the ideology of members? Are members polarizing? Why?
     - What is the relationship between chambers and between the legislative and executive branches?
       - What is the effect of divided compared to unified government?
       - Why does certain legislation get adopted or not?
       - What are the limits to Congressional and Presidential authority? E.g., over executive and judicial nominations, war-making, and the operation of the bureaucracy?
     - How does a Presidential and bicameral system differ in terms of representation and policy output from a Westminster/parliamentary/unicameral system?
     
     - How can we study these things?
